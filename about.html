					We are Scott and Carla Hammon, we've been married for 23 years, worked together 10 years, and haven't killed each other yet.
				</p>
				<p class="dark">
					After many years of working in the auto parts industry Scott decided it was time to venture outside.  He then worked for a local pool business and fell in love with the it.  He had always dreamt of owning his own business and in he 2006 stepped out in faith and became THE POOL DUDE.  Shortly thereafter, Carla followed suit and became his "Pool Dudette."  Scott does all the manual labor and Carla keeps track of the orders and appointments, as well as keeping Scott in line and busy.
